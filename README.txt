I am a currently taking a Machine Learning course online. I am using this repository to hold all the assignments I've worked on, along with my solutions.  While much of the code is provided by the folks at Coursera (who I am not affiliated with), the solutions are mine.  All code is in Octave which should translate smoothly to MATLAB.

Exercises:

   1) Week 2 - Minimize the cost function with single and multiple variables using both gradient descent and the normal equation.
